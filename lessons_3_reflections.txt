When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  If you push changes to GitHub from another computer
  or if another person is working on your project who pushes changes to GitHub

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. 
When would you use one instead of another?
	
	Brunch I will use on my local computer/repository

	Fork allows to make copy of somebody else's repository directly on the GitHub in my profile GitHub 
	without pulling the file to my local computer

	Clone I will use if I want to edit the code on my own computer

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?

	Git is Version Control System
	GitHub is a hosting service for Git repositories. 
	Git is the tool, GitHub is the service for projects that use Git.

	Collaborate without using GitHub would be harder
	Because Github allows you to:
	Share your repositories with others.
	Access other user's repositories.
	Store remote copies of your repositories (github servers) as backup of your local copies.
	
When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? 
What benefits does each approach have?

	If you want to try new feature or you work on new part of project 
	then a good practice will be using a separate branch
