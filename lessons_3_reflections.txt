When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  If you push changes to GitHub from another computer
  or if another person is working on your project who pushes changes to GitHub

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. 
When would you use one instead of another?
	
	Brunch I will use on my local computer/repository

	Fork allows to make copy of somebody else's repository directly on the GitHub in my profile GitHub 
	without pulling the file to my local computer

	Clone I will use if I want to edit the code on my own computer
